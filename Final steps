# Define task dependencies

ingest_task >> clean_task >> train_task >> serve_task
Step 3: Run and Automate the Pipeline
•	Once you've written the Airflow DAG, run the pipeline by visiting the Airflow UI.
•	The Ingest Task will download and store the data.
•	The Clean and Store Task will clean the data and load it into the database.
•	The Train Model Task will train a recommendation model and store predictions.
•	The Serve Recommendations Task will simulate serving recommendations.

Step 4: Enhancements for Production-Level Pipeline
1.	Data Partitioning: Add support for partitioning data by date to handle large datasets.
2.	Error Handling: Include error handling and retry logic in the Airflow tasks.
3.	Monitoring: Set up monitoring for pipeline tasks using Airflow’s built-in alerting.
4.	Model Versioning: Use a model registry like MLflow to track model versions and performance.
5.	Deploy the Model as a REST API: Serve predictions via an API using FastAPI or Flask.
