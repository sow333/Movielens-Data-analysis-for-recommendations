# Movielens-Data-analysis-for-recommendations
Data analysis for movielens data 

Building a data pipeline for MovieLens data analysis and recommendations involves automating the steps of data ingestion, processing, storage, model training, and serving the recommendations. Below is an architecture and a step-by-step guide on how you can set up this pipeline using common tools like Apache Airflow (for orchestration), SQL databases (for storage), and machine learning libraries like Surprise for collaborative filtering-based recommendations.

# Data Pipeline Architecture

1.	Data Ingestion: Load raw MovieLens dataset.
2.	Data Cleaning: Clean and transform the data.
3.	Data Storage: Store data in a SQL database.
4.	Feature Engineering: Prepare features for recommendation models.
5.	Model Training: Train a collaborative filtering model.
6.	Recommendations Serving: Generate and serve movie recommendations.

Tools Used:
•	Apache Airflow for orchestration.
•	Python & Pandas for data cleaning and feature engineering.
•	SQLite/PostgreSQL for storage.
•	Surprise for collaborative filtering recommendations.
•	Docker (optional) for containerization.
